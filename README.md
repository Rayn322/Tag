# Tag
A Minecraft server plugin so you can play tag with your friends!

## Using the plugin
-   /tag start <length of game in minutes (optional)> - Starts the game of tag. This will warp everyone to a random spot in the world. Whoever ran the command will be it first and the game will start after 3 seconds. If no length is specified the game will be infinite. Currently, no decimals are allowed.
-   /tag stop - Stops the game and returns you to your original position.
-   /tag coordinates <x> <z> - Sets coordinates to use. Leave blank for random coordinates.
-   /tag reload - Reloads the config. It's recommended to change the config with commands rather than edit it manually.

## Supported Versions
Currently, the only supported versions are 1.17 to 1.13.
